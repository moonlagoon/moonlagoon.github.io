                <p>Hello! I've been working since I've turned 16. I graduated in the class of 2016 out of
                    Reynoldsburg
                    Ohio. I would love to work alongside your business. Iâ€™ve been working for about 6 years now
                    and I
                    feel really comfortable with any work setting and catch on very fast. I'm very social and
                    outgoing.
                    I can get along with anyone easily. Having my working experiences and my skills makes me
                    confident
                    that I confident that I can take on any job.
                    Giving me this opportunity to me would make me very grateful. I would love an interview to
                    discuss
                    further more about working with the company. Thank you so much for your time.
                    <br><br>
                    Sincerely,
                    Luna Routsong
